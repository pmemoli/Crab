C compiler written in Rust based on Sandler Nora's book "Writing a C Compiler". The project is just the the preprocessed C to ASM compiler. Preprocessor and Linker comes from gcc. 

Very much a WIP.

TODO:
- Write parser for unary expressions.
- Make lexer and parser work with Result's rather than just panicking for errors.
